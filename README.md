### Following are The Key Points About Project.

<br>

### 1) Abstract. üßæ
<br>
<p>Library management system is a project which aims in developing a computerized system to maintain all the daily work of library .This project has features which are generally not available in normal library management systems like existing system does not have any facility to generate student reports as well as book issue reports where as proposed system provides it. It has also a facility to send an email to that particular student whose return book deadline crosses. We also generate the different charts which differentiate our project with existing Library systems. Overall this project of ours is being developed to help the users and librarian to maintain the library in the best way possible and also reduce the human efforts.</p>

### 2) Introduction. üìê
<br>
<p>The project Library Management System is developed in C-sharp, which mainly focuses on basic operations in library like adding new members, new books, and updating new information, searching books and members to borrow and return books. With the ever-increasing sea of information, this modern function of library is becoming very complex and tedious to handle manually. The librarian has to devote most of his/her time to handing such functions of library. So after conducting the feasibility study we decided to make the manual Library management system to be computerized. We tried our best to make our project which shall provide user friendly interface
</p>

### 3) Description. üôå
<br>
<p>This project fulfill the client requirements where this  Library Management System can perform various functions like adding new members, new books, and updating
new information, searching books or members to borrow or return books.
This project can also full the client requirement to send email to those students whose deadline of return book is exceed. It can also show issuance chart and threshold chart for instant report. According to the user requirement the system should send email to the registered students whenever we add a new book to this system.
</p>

### 4) Objectives ‚ö°.
<br>

* `Insertion`. Complete insertion of student data, books data and record of book issued or returned to/by particular in to database. 

*	`Extraction`:	complete extraction of student data, books data and record of book issued or returned to/by particular from database. 

*	`Keep Record`: Keeping all record of borrowed or issued books list, fine maintains and student and books details.

*	`Searching`: Searching Facility system, Search for books and members and other type of searches from database.

*	`Charts Creation`: This functionality enables the user (admin) to create issuance chart and threshold chart for instant report generation.  

*	`Sending Email` To Registered Students: To fulfill the user requirement to send email to the students whenever a new book added or when deadline of book return crosses.	 

### 5) Scope üßø.

<br>
<p>To utilize resources in an efficient manner by increasing their productivity
through automation. There is a future scope of this facility that many more features such as online lectures video tutorials can be added by teachers as well as online assignments submission facility, a feature Of group chat where students can discuss various issues of engineering can be added to this project thus making it more interactive more user friendly and project which fulfills each users need in the best way possible. The different areas where we can use this application are.

*	Any education institute can make use of it for providing information about author, content of the available books.
*	It can be used in offices and modifications can be easily done according to requirements.
